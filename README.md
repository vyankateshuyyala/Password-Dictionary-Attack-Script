1. Downloads the Wordlist: First, the script fetches a wordlist of 500 commonly used (and therefore weak) passwords from SecLists using the requests library.

2. Iterates and Submits Passwords: It then iterates through each password in the downloaded wordlist. For each password, it sends a POST request to the Flask application's /dictionary endpoint, including the password in the request's form data.

3. Analyzes Responses: The script checks the response status code after each request. If it's 200 (OK), it examines the response content further. If the response contains the "flag" key, it signifies a successful login. The script then prints the discovered password.

 4.Continues or Terminates: If the response doesn't indicate success, the script proceeds to the next password in the wordlist. This process continues until the correct password is found or the entire wordlist is exhausted.
